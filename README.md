# Model-Book-Recommendation-System
Book recommendation systems as one of the recommendation systems, focus on suggesting books based on reading preferences. Traditional methods use features like genre and author, but these can overlook intricate patterns and user preferences. Implementing a book recommendation system can address issues like information overload and manual exploration of libraries.
To automate and effectively search for preferred books, this project focuses on building a book recommendation system with simple cosine similarity using TensorFlow Recommenders. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in enhancing user experiences by suggesting personalized content. In the range of books, traditional methods may overlook complex user preferences. This project aims to build a book recommendation system using TensorFlow Recommenders and deploy a web-based application interface. The project involves data preparation, model formulation, training, and evaluation, ultimately resulting in a user-friendly web application that provides real-time book recommendations based on user input. In the end, TensorFlow Recommenders demonstrates greater potential in delivering accurate and tailored recommendations. Using intricate patterns and user interaction embeddings, it excels in aligning recommendations with user preferences. The model's performance is quantifiable through metrics like RMSE, enabling precise evaluation and meaningful comparison.
